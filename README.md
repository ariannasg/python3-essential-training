## Description
Follow a series of courses to train and improve python skills.

## Python 3 - Essentials
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/

The code for this codes lives on the [essentials folder](./essentials).

This course covers the basics of the language syntax and usage, as well as advanced features such as objects, generators, and exceptions. Learn how types and values are related to objects; how to use control statements, loops, and functions; and how to work with generators and decorators.

#### Objectives
- Python anatomy
- Types and values
- Conditionals and operators
- Building loops
- Defining functions
- Python data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and more
- Creating classes
- Handling exceptions
- Working with strings
- File input/output (I/O)
- Creating modules
- Integrating a database with Python db-api

## Advanced Python
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/

The code for this codes lives on the [advanced folder](./advanced).

This courses shows shows to leverage Python features such as object-oriented special class methods, using logging to track performance and user activity, how to port code from Python 2 to 3, and how to make the code more efficient and easier to read and maintain.
also shows how to manipulate data, build custom classes and functions, create lists, and write more elegant, optimized code.

#### Objectives
- Truth value testing
- Template strings for string formatting
- Generic built-ins: any, all, sum, min, max
- Iterators: next, iter, enumerate, zip, itertools
- Transforms: sorted, filter, map
- Advanced Python functions: docstrings, variable argument lists, lambdas, keyword-only arguments
- Advanced collections: namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter, OrderedDict, deque
- Advanced classes and objects
- Logging
- Python comprehensions: list, dictionary, and set
