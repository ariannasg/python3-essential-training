## Description
Follow a series of courses to train and improve Python skills.

## Python 3 - Essentials
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/

The code for this codes lives on the [essentials folder](./essentials).

This course covers the basics of the language syntax and usage, as well as advanced features such as objects, generators, and exceptions. Learn how types and values are related to objects; how to use control statements, loops, and functions; and how to work with generators and decorators.

#### Objectives
- Python anatomy
- Types and values
- Conditionals and operators
- Building loops
- Defining functions
- Python data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and more
- Creating classes
- Handling exceptions
- Working with strings
- File input/output (I/O)
- Creating modules
- Integrating a database with Python db-api

## Advanced Python
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/

The code for this codes lives on the [advanced folder](./advanced).

This courses shows shows to leverage Python features such as object-oriented special class methods, using logging to track performance and user activity, how to port code from Python 2 to 3, and how to make the code more efficient and easier to read and maintain.
Also shows how to manipulate data, build custom classes and functions, create lists, and write more elegant, optimized code.

#### Objectives
- Truth value testing
- Template strings for string formatting
- Generic built-ins: any, all, sum, min, max
- Iterators: next, iter, enumerate, zip, itertools
- Transforms: sorted, filter, map
- Advanced Python functions: docstrings, variable argument lists, lambdas, keyword-only arguments
- Advanced collections: namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter, OrderedDict, deque
- Advanced classes and objects: enums, custom string and bytes representation of objects, computed attributes, support for numerical operations and support for comparisons 
- Logging
- Python comprehensions: list, dictionary, and set

## Python Standard Library Essential Training
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-standard-library-essential-training/

The code for this codes lives on the [standard_library folder](./standard_library).

Understand more about the library of pre-built code — known as the Python standard library — that’s distributed along with the language.
See how the library can help to work with numbers, calculate and format dates and times, parse HTML, and more.

#### Objectives
- Basic string operations
- Searching strings
- Manipulating data
- Using efficient arrays
- Creating temporary files and directories
- Reading and writing CSV and ZIP files
- Generating unique identifiers
- Calculating dates and times
- Retrieving internet data

## Local setup
Follow the instructions to get the project up and running for local development and testing purposes.
- Install python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
- Configure the IDE Interpreter to use Python 3 and setup the run configuration: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html?keymap=secondary_macos.
- Ideally create a dedicated virtual environment for the project and use it as the project interpreter in the IDE.
